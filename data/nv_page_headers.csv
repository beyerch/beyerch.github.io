0,Introduction,Introduction,"<B><I>Introduction</I></B><BR><BR><BR>After the sudden on-set of COVID-19 in China, it has spread rapidly across the globe.  In a relatively short span of time, millions of people have been infected and hundreds of thousands have died.  This narrative visualization will provide you with key information about COVID-19 on both a Worldwide and Country level: infections statistics, fatality statistics, and government stringency measures.  (e.g. How stringent were policies enacted in an attempt to stop/slow the spread of the virus).<BR><BR>Each section will provide a brief overview and will then allow you to explore freely to view the underlying data. <BR>The main goals of this presentation are to demonstrate the rapid rise in infection, fatality, and government response.  Secondly, you can use this data to attempt to correlate the success/failure of government procedures against the virus.",
1,Infections,COVID-19 Infections ,"<B><I>Overview</I></B><BR><BR><BR>While COVID-19 was initially limited to China, the virus quickly spread across the world.<BR><BR>At the end of January 2020, there were just under 10,000 confirmed cases.  By the end of February, the number of confirmed cases jumped eight-fold to 85,000 due to the virus spreading outside of China.  The outlook worsened further in March as the infection total jumped to 800,000 cases and more countries began reporting their first cases.<BR><BR>Due to the rapid spread of the virus, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11th.  The United States followed suit and declared a national emergency two days later.   <BR><BR>While governmental response to the virus increased significantly in many countries, subsequent months have also reflected large numbers of infections, though the growth rate was slower from May - early July.  While many countries have stabilized the impact of COVID, a significant jump in infections have been reported in July.",total_cases 
2,Deaths,Deaths,"<B><I>Overview</I></B><BR><BR><BR>Deaths, due to COVID-19, rapidly increased in correlation with the rapid spread of the virus to various countries.  Countries and localities with large numbers of infections suffered significant deaths as their hospital systems could not handle the influx of patients.<BR><BR>While it took almost 2 months to record 2,000 deaths worldwide, slightly over a month later, over 38,000 deaths were reported.  Not even two weeks later, worldwide deaths hit the 100,000 mark!<BR><BR>Similar to infection rates, the death rate did start to slow in May as countries ramped up policies to slow the spread of the virus and to treat those already infected.",total_deaths
3,Stringency,Government Response,"<B><I>Overview</I></B><BR><BR><BR>In the early months of the disease, there was little concern outside of China.  While there was some discussion of a possible viral situation in late December 2019 / early January 2020, many countries did not truly comprehend the severity of the virus.  From December 2019 - Early March 2020, most countries did not have any significant plans in place to fight the spread of the virus.<BR><BR>Things quickly changed in mid-March as the WHO labeled the virus as a pandemic and numerous countries reported large number of infections.  Many countries significantly ramped up containment efforts, virus testing, and closed borders to travelers from known high risk areas.<BR><BR>For most of the countries, who implemented strict measures early, they reported significantly lower infection/death rates.  These countries also scaled back their policies in late-May/early-June allowing citizens to begin resuming normal activities.  Some countries, who have not done as good of a job, are not fairing as well.<BR><BR>One interesting data point is that some countries which have very strict plans in place did not recover as well from the virus.  This may be due to the general public not following the measures put in place by government.",stringency_index
